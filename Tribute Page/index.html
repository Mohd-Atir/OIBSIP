        A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, (born
        October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong),
        Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in the
        development of India's missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was
        president of India from 2002 to 2007. Kalam earned a degree in
        aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in
        1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In
        1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was
        project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that
        was both designed and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam
        planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which
        helped earn him the nickname “Missile Man.” Among those successes was
        Agni, India's first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which
        incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989. From 1992
        to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he
        later served as principal scientific adviser (1999-2001) to the
        government with the rank of cabinet minister. His prominent role in the
        country's 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power
        and established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused
        great concern in the international community. In 1998 Kalam put forward
        a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as
        a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed
        society in 20 years. The plan called for, among other measures,
        increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a
        vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and
        education. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam A.P.J. Abdul Kalam In 2002 India's ruling
        National Democratic Alliance (NDA) put forward Kalam to succeed outgoing
        President Kocheril Raman Narayanan. Kalam was nominated by the Hindu
        nationalist (Hindutva) NDA even though he was Muslim, and his stature
        and popular appeal were such that even the main opposition party, the
        Indian National Congress, also proposed his candidacy. Kalam easily won
        the election and was sworn in as India's 11th president, a largely
        ceremonial post, in July 2002. He left office at the end of his term in
        2007 and was succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the country's first woman
        president. Upon returning to civilian life, Kalam remained committed to
        using science and technology to transform India into a developed country
        and served as a lecturer at several universities. On July 27, 2015, he
        collapsed while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of
        Management Shillong and was pronounced dead from cardiac arrest soon
        afterward. Kalam wrote several books, including an autobiography, Wings
        of Fire (1999). Among his numerous awards were two of the country's
        highest honours, the Padma Vibhushan (1990) and the Bharat Ratna (1997).
        Kalam was the youngest of five siblings, the eldest of whom was a
        sister, Asim Zohra (d.1997), followed by three elder brothers: Mohammed
        Muthu Meera Lebbai Maraikayar (5 November 1916 - 7 March
        2021), Mustafa Kalam (d.1999) and Kasim Mohammed
        (d.1995).[124] He was extremely close to his elder siblings and their
        extended families throughout his life, and would regularly send small
        sums of money to his older relations, himself remaining a lifelong
        bachelor. Kalam was noted for his integrity and his simple
        lifestyle. He never owned a television, and was in the habit
        of rising at 6:30 or 7 a.m. and sleeping by 2 a.m. His few personal
        possessions included his books, his veena, some articles of clothing, a
        CD player and a laptop; at his death, he left no will, and his
        possessions went to his eldest brother, who survived him.
